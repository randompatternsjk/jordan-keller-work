<div class="flex basis-full">
  Ugh. Those three words. We hear them from skeptical business owners repeating
  stories of disgruntled Groupon merchants, and from lapsed customers relaying
  their bad Groupon experiences. But bad Groupon experiences are rare. We’re
  much better, much more often than those stories make us seem. Our app has 5
  stars, damn it! If we can meet merchants where they’re at with their negative
  perception of Groupon, own up to how we’ve fallen short, and introduce them to
  who we are today, then we could start earning their trust again. We could own
  the conversation around those three words, and shift their mindset from “Dont
  Use Groupon” to “Dont. Use Groupon.”
