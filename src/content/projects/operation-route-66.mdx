title: 'Operation Route 66'
description: 'A family with no ties to the military realize 150 veterans returning home from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are dying weekly by their own hands. Their love for America and a curiosity to learn about the struggles of the returning combat veteran compel them to travel through the heart of the country to meet and thank returning veterans. The decision to use motorcycles across Route 66 provides the visceral connection to the landscape and the Americans they meet. This film is their love letter to both.'
